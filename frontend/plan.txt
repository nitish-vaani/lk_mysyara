#Create a login page with security features.
#After login the person reaches a dashboard page where they get the information like;
    Total number of calls
    Total calls picked
    Total leads

#The header will have the option to signout, call history page
#The call history page will have the list of all calls. (I will give an example how)
#The call history and dashboard page will both have a filter option.
#Call history page will have the export to csv button.
